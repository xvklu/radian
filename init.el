;; The general outline of this file is as follows:
;;
;; * Set up variables and functions for managing user-specific
;;   configuration. This needs to be done first because the
;;   user-specific options could affect the behavior of anything else
;;   in the file.
;;
;; * Run the user-specific configuration file init.before.local.el.
;;
;; * Perform configuration of native Emacs functionality.
;;
;; * Bootstrap use-package.
;;
;; * Load and configure packages.
;;
;; * Load color schemes and perform other appearance tweaks that look
;;   odd unless they are done at the very end of initialization.
;;
;; * Run the user-specific configuration file init.local.el.

;;;; User-specific configuration variables

;;; The following are user-specific configuration options that can be
;;; overridden in init.before.local.el. They parsed by
;;; create-init-before-local-el.sh so the user can set them up
;;; interactively. Configuration variables marked with "For manual
;;; configuration only" are placed in the created init.before.local.el
;;; file, but the user is not offered the option to change their
;;; values interactively.
;;;
;;; Here we are using the defvar-nil-setq pattern described in [1],
;;; which makes it so that changes to these declarations will be
;;; picked up by a reload of init.el (M-RET r).

;; Radian color scheme (Solarized Light + Leuven), which is

;; and make sure to set your terminal emulator to use the Solarized

  "This function is the normal value of the variable `lisp-indent-function'.
The function `calculate-lisp-indent' calls this to determine
if the arguments of a Lisp function call should be indented specially.
INDENT-POINT is the position at which the line being indented begins.
Point is located at the point to indent under (for default indentation);
STATE is the `parse-partial-sexp' state for that position.
If the current line is in a call to a Lisp function that has a non-nil
property `lisp-indent-function' (or the deprecated `lisp-indent-hook'),
it specifies how to indent.  The property value can be:
* `defun', meaning indent `defun'-style
  \(this is also the case if there is no property and the function
  has a name that begins with \"def\", and three or more arguments);
* an integer N, meaning indent the first N arguments specially
  (like ordinary function arguments), and then indent any further
  arguments like a body;
* a function to call that returns the indentation (or nil).
  `lisp-indent-function' calls this function with the same two arguments
  that it itself received.
This function returns either the indentation to use, or nil if the

  ;; Note that this does *not* help in the case of things going so
