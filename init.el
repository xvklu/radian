;; The general outline of this file is as follows:
;;
;; * Set up variables and functions for managing user-specific
;;   configuration. This needs to be done first because the
;;   user-specific options could affect the behavior of anything else
;;   in the file.
;;
;; * Run the user-specific configuration file init.before.local.el.
;;
;; * Perform configuration of native Emacs functionality.
;;
;; * Bootstrap use-package.
;;
;; * Load and configure packages.
;;
;; * Load color schemes and perform other appearance tweaks that look
;;   odd unless they are done at the very end of initialization.
;;
;; * Run the user-specific configuration file init.local.el.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;; User-specific configuration variables

;;; The following are user-specific configuration options that can be
;;; overridden in init.before.local.el. They parsed by
;;; create-init-before-local-el.sh so the user can set them up
;;; interactively. Configuration variables marked with "For manual
;;; configuration only" are placed in the created init.before.local.el
;;; file, but the user is not offered the option to change their
;;; values interactively.
;;;
;;; Here we are using the defvar-nil-setq pattern described in [1],
;;; which makes it so that changes to these declarations will be
;;; picked up by a reload of init.el (M-RET r).
;;;
;;; [1]: http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_defvar_problem.html

;; Control color customizations. If you want to use the default
;; Radian color scheme (Solarized Light + Leuven), which is
;; guaranteed to work in terminal Emacs, set this to `t' (default)
;; and make sure to set your terminal emulator to use the Solarized
;; Light color scheme. This will also turn on various tweaks designed
;; to make various parts of the Leuven theme look better. If you want
;; to set up your own color scheme, or use the Emacs default, set
;; this to `nil'.

;; Control completion mechanisms. If this is `helm-ido', then Helm is
;; used for most completions and IDO is used for finding files. If it
;; is `ivy', then Ivy and Counsel are used for most completions. By
;; default, this also enables Swiper for Isearches. You can disable
;; this functionality by placing (radian-disable-package 'swiper) in
;; your init.before.local.el. Note that selecting `helm-ido' or `ivy'

;; Add a :quelpa keyword to `use-package', which allows installing

;; slow. But quelpa-use-package loads quelpa eagerly. So we have to
;; use my fork of quelpa-use-package, which fixes that. But installing
;; from a fork requires quelpa. But we don't want to load it eagerly.
;; So we have to use my fork of quelpa-use-package...
;;
;; The solution here is to use two separate code paths. On first
;; install, quelpa will be loaded eagerly and used to install
;; quelpa-use-package. But after that, quelpa-use-package can install
;; itself, thus solving the problem of quelpa being loaded eagerly.
;;
;; (Note that, as long as we are using my fork, loading
;; quelpa-use-package eagerly is not a problem. In fact, it's required
;; because we need to activate its advice before processing
;; use-package forms that might contain `:quelpa' keywords.)
;;
;; To maintain reverse compatibility, my fork of quelpa-use-package
;; only lazily loads quelpa if the variable
;; `quelpa-use-package-inhibit-loading-quelpa' is non-nil (it is nil
;; by default). So we have to set it here. But we also want to allow
;; for disabling that optimization in the case that
;; `radian-reload-init' is called with a prefix argument. To solve
;; this problem we use `defvar', which will only set
;; `radian--inhibit-loading-quelpa' to `t' if that variable has not
;; already been defined. That way, we can override the value of
